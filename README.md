# fuelCellChannelBypass
Set of codes developed to predict the effect of bypass channels on fuel cell performance:
1) PredictByPassMovement.m - This code evaluates an analytical prediction for the balance between viscous shear and intertial corner pressure drop for a single fuel cell serpentine channel. It compares the predictions from the analytical model to OpenFOAM, VOF CFD.

2) halfUnitCellDiffusivity.m - This code evaluates an analytical prediction for the reduction in effective diffusivity of a half-rib, half-channel unit cell due to the presence of a condensing water film under the rib.
